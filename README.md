# flyWorld_game
Basic Maze game on Java GUI

Assignment 1 - CPS112.


For this assignment, develop a simple game called “Fly Away Home.” The basic idea behind 
the game is to safely move Mosca the Fly around a grid to the home square before he gets eaten. The user will 
control the movements of the fly using arrow keys, and the frogs will move on their own.
